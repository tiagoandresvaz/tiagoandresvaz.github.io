Covid-19 Scenarios (by Neherlab) My contribution to the model, was to implement a new flux in the SIR model called “Palliative Flux”. The implementation was done using Typescript, Python and Node.js and involved many kinds of validations and complex epidemiology modelling. To accomplish this I had to set cloud environments (dev and production) with Continuous Integration and Delivery of software, so statisticians could work on local models. Our environment was equipped with a data parser, to capture data from our local government dashboards and after processing than, I have customized the calculator to build specific scenarios for 26 local regions. This was a work group with collaboration from statistics, medicine and computer science teachers from the federal university along with state authorities.

I am the former Project Manager and Technical Leader. Since the very first day I am an observer of the great progress that the project and his branches are delivering across the country. In 2016, we have put it as the most adopted university hospital software in Brasil. In 2017 the project received a Public Innovation Award from ENAP. Now the project is maintained by the “Comunidade AGHUse: that includes partners like UNICAMP, Army, AirForce, states and other universities. Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (+900 beds) was appointed by the federal government in 2009 as a blueprint for a digital healthcare business model.

Provides solutions for hospitals to revamp infection control, help schools preventing outbreaks and hotels auditing protocols. In the future, we hope ISA will be an expert in infection related problems.

#### Covid Vaccines Effectiveness (CoVE) 

https://www.uu.nl/en/research/eu-pepv-research-network/effectiveness-of-heterologous-and-booster-covid-19-vaccination-in-5-european-countries


As Core Scientific Lead, I designed and coordinated this international project involving multiple European universities to evaluate the effectiveness of heterologous and booster COVID-19 vaccination schedules in five countries. Our research used a cohort approach, focusing on both children and adults who completed a full primary vaccination regimen.

I led the development of a robust data pipeline, ensuring data from all partners adhered to a synthetic common data model and harmonized semantic libraries. This enabled consistent analysis and interpretation of health data across diverse international contexts.

**Participating Organisations:**
- Utrecht University, The Netherlands (Consortium Lead)
- AEMPS, Spain (Coordinator)
- UMC Utrecht, The Netherlands
- VAC4EU, Belgium
- Democritus University of Thrace, Greece
- APHP, France
- ARS, Italy
- INSPIRE, Italy
- SoSeTe-Pedianet, Italy
- Rīga Stradiņš University, Latvia
- PHARMO Institute, The Netherlands
- RIVM, The Netherlands
- IACS, Spain
- IDIAPJGol, Spain
- RTI Health Solutions, Spain
- Servicio Navarro de Salud, Spain
- Teamit Institute, Spain
- DSRU, UK

**Project Documentation:**
- [Study Protocol (approved by the European Union)](https://catalogues.ema.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_files/D2_StudyProtocol_v0.4_ROC12_FINAL_20220615.pdf)

- [CoVE Project Repository (Zenodo)](https://zenodo.org/records/7858776)

**Key Results:**
- [Effectiveness of homologous/heterologous booster COVID-19 vaccination schedules against severe illness in general population and clinical subgroups in three European countries (PubMed)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37858451/)



#### Covid-19 Scenarios (by Neherlab)

My contribution to the model, was to implement a new flux in the SIR model called "Palliative Flux". Coding models  with Python, amd UI with Typescript. React and Node.js. The model in Python was coded involving many kinds of statistics and complex epidemiology modelling. 

To accomplish this, I had to set cloud environments (dev and production) with Continuous Integration and Delivery of software, so statisticians could work on local models.

Our environment was equipped with a data parser, to capture data from our local government dashboards and after processing than, I have customized the calculator to build specific scenarios for 26 local regions.

This was a work group with collaboration from statistics, medicine and computer science teachers from the federal university along with state authorities.

#### AGHUse (by Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre)
Co-author of the registered GPL software at INPI, AGHUse is a comprehensive EHR (Electronic Health Record) and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system designed for healthcare providers of all types.

I initiated the project and named it AGHUse together with Elisa Kopstein from the communications team. after the original AGHU "mother" project and the old AGH "father" project. As the original Technical Leader and later IT Executive, I led the rollout in a large 1,000-bed hospital, covering primary care, emergency, maternity, psychiatry, heart transplants, and all the advanced features needed for such a complex environment.

From the beginning, I have witnessed the project's growth and its positive impact across Brazil. By 2016, AGHUse became the most widely adopted university hospital software in the country. In 2017, it received the Public Innovation Award from ENAP.

Today, the project is maintained by the "Comunidade AGHUse," which includes partners such as UNICAMP, the Army, Air Force, local governments, and other universities.

Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (+900 beds) was appointed by the federal government in 2009 as a blueprint for a digital healthcare business model. Now its software is shared across the country.

#### AGHU (by EBSERH - Empresa Brasileira de Servicos Hospitalares)

AGHU is a complete EHR (Electronic Health Record) designed to fit University Hospitals in all 5 regions from Brazil. 

From South to North, I was the former Technical Leader, co-authored the source code in Java and latter became the IT Executive in charge for rolling out it on the first 23 hospitals, including small, medium and large hospitals. 

Now the project is maintained by EBSERH in partnership with a community formed by multiple universities.

#### Infection Surveillance Assistant (by Qualis Infectologia)

As head of AI and data expert, Ive build the AI mode to implement ISA - Infection Surveillance Assistant. Made by automated artificial intelligence running at Amazon AWS. Provides solutions for hospitals to revamp infection control. 

In the future, we hope ISA will be an expert in infection related problems.
